# Benchmark-Real-world-Underwater-Dataset-BRUD-
These real-world underwater RGB images were collected using Geneinno T1 Pro ROV at three different geographical locations, namely, Lake Linden, Portage Lake Chassell, and Portage Lake (GLRC) in Michigan Upper peninsula. The ROV is equipped with a 1/2.3'' SONY CMOS camera with 4K video resolution. In this dataset, 100 randomly selected images have been used based on the depth variability. The images are categorized into three parts based on the water depth: (1) less than 1 meter, (2) depth from 2-3 meters, and (3) depth from 2-3 meters.
